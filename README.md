---

# Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
- 500,000+ transactions from a UK-based online retailer (2010–2011)



## Objective

Build a machine learning pipeline to:
- Analyze patterns in cancelled vs. completed orders
- Engineer customer, product, and time-based features
- Train a **stacked ensemble model (XGBoost + Random Forest)**
- Deploy a prediction UI using **Streamlit**
